  <h3> <li> My parents split when I was 6 and later my mom met my step dad </li> </h3>
  <h3 <li> My step dad already had a child, which now makes her my step sister. I never meet her because she lives in Japan and doesn't really speak English well. </li> </h3>
  <h3> <li> When I moved here we got a puppy, me and my mom really wanted another one. The day we got her we weren't expecting to bring her home we were just looking around. 
  But then I begged my mom and she gave in, and we named her Shippou ( That means tail in Japanese) </li> </h3>
  <h3> <li> In 2013 they had my sister Daisy. I'm 10 years older then her (its a big differences) </li> </h3> 
  <h3> <li> At my dad's house it's him and I and two kittens. A boy named Salem and a girl named Akasha. </li> </h3>
  <h3> <li> In total I have 11 cousins </li> </h3>
