  <li> My favorite color is blue, I like all shades of blue but mainly lighter blues I like. </li>
  <li> I love to play video games, My top favorite games would have to be Fortnite, GTA 5, Overwatch, and Rocket league. 
    I like games where you can do whatever you want with friends online. Thats why I like GTA so much. Playing on xbox is one on my most favorite things to do in my free time.</li>
  <li> Being around friends and family. I love going out places with friends and having a good time doing whatever we want. 
    I also like going to family gatherings and catching up with thoses I haven't seen in a long time.</li>
  <li> My favorite sports are hockey and basketball. My favorite hockey team is the Philadelphia Flyers and I have been to one of there games when I was 8.
    It's also the only sport I watch on tv. But basketball is my most favorite sport to play. I was on the freshmen team this year and it help me a whole lot learn new things about the sport.</li>
