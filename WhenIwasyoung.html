  <h3> What I did </h3>
<div> I was really shy when I was young. But when I was around my family and people I was close to I was hyper. 
  But I loved playing outside, talking to friends, and spending time with family. My favorite tv shows that I watched were iCarly and spongebob.
  I didnt play with toys much but when I did it was my doll house and dolls. From when I moved here I still am friends with pretty much alll of them, my best friend is named Niki.
