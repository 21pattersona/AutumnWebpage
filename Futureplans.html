	<h2> In my Future I see... </h2>
 <p id="alert">I dont have big plans to go to college, if I do it might head towards online college. I feel it would be best for me.
	What I want to major in is maybe in business and minor in video production. For my first job I want to work at a restaurant and 
	be a waiter. But for when Im older for a more perment job maybe to work with money because im good with math and lke them both..</p> 
	
<p id="alert"> I want to live in New Jersey or move to Flordia or somewhere by the beach area when Im ready to live on my own. I dont really know
	when or if I want kids but im sure I will, I would want 2 or 3 kids maybe 2 boys and a girl.  I would like to travel somewhere new every year 
	as well. I love flying and the idea of travling its really exciting to me. I would really like to vist Hawaii and Bora Bora. I dont go on many
	vactions so it would be really cool to go to these places.</p>
