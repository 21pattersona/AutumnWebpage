  <p class="round3">In my free time</p> 
  <div> <p> When I get home from school and have no home work, I usally get a snack and go on my phone.
    Then I may take a nap or go on xbox and see if my friends are on (usally they aren't). Some days when it is really nice out
    I may go to the park and ride my bike around town. If I get super bored and have ideas I make a video for my Youtube channel. 
    I use to make gameing videos on there but now I just do whenever. </div> </p>
    
    <p class="round3">What I enjoy doing </p>
    <div> <p> I enjoy making things online like videos and art on the computer. I also like drawing and riding my bike.
      In the summer my most favorite thing to do is go to the beach. I love going there in August when the sun is setting,
      the waeather is perfect and the water is just right and I love being there. On day I want to get a beach house to go 
      down there in summer, that would be a dream come true. </div> </p>
